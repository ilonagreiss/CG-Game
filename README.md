# CG-Game

This is an infinite jumper game by Ilona Grei√ü (580838) and Koco Dhami (580776).
The base of the game is inspired by following tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM&t=684s

Additionally we incorporated following features:
- Start screen
- End screen (with re-try, quit button and score)
- Ghost power up: character can not die, while ghost mode (ananas)
- Score power up: adds 5 points to score (cherry)
- Added external design (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/pixel-adventure-1-155360#content)
- Game over, if character is out of bounds (game screen)
- Sound effects from <a href="https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=music&utm_content=38299">Pixabay</a>
